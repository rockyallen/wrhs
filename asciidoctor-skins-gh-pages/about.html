Markdown is superbly simple. Perfect for writing quick notes and pages with a basic structure. Asciidoctor is superbly sophisticated. Where markdown fails, asciidoc/asciidoctor allows you to document things with ease, fine grain control and a civilised demeanor, worlds away from hair wrenching word processors.
But the default asciidoc “look” may be getting boring.
